### 💡 About me  

I build mobile apps with a focus on clarity, speed, and care for the user. My core stack is Swift, and I love turning messy ideas into clean, maintainable features. I’m into thoughtful architecture, neat UI, and the little performance wins that make apps feel effortless. Lately I’m also diving into Flutter to broaden my cross-platform skill set.
