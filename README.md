### 💡 About me

I’m a mobile developer with a strong iOS background, focused on building clear, maintainable, and user-friendly applications.

My core expertise is Swift, where I enjoy turning complex requirements into simple, well-structured solutions. I care deeply about code readability, thoughtful architecture, and UI details that make apps feel calm and effortless rather than busy or fragile.

Recently, I’ve been expanding into Flutter to bring the same engineering mindset to cross-platform development — learning the framework through real-world projects rather than demos or tutorials.
