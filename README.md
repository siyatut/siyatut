Hi 🍃 My name is Anastasiia Tiutinova
=====================================
iOS developer
-------------
Transitioned to IT from customer support. Started learning Swift and iOS development with mentors in January 2023. I prefer learning from books, documentation, and articles. Passionate about growth and exploring new technologies.

### 💡 Tech stack & experience:

* **Programming language**: Swift
* **Architectures**: VIPER, MVVM
* **Data persistence**: Core Data, UserDefaults
* **Concurrency**: GCD (Grand Central Dispatch)
* **Reactive programming**: Combine
* **UI & animations**: UIKit (including UICollectionView, UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout, UITableView,  
  custom cells, and smooth UI interactions), with limited experience in SwiftUI.
* **Unit testing**: XCTest
* **Static analysis**: SwiftLint
* **Version control**: Git/GitHub

I've worked on apps that include task management with local/remote data synchronization and habit tracking with interactive UI and analytics. 
Constantly improving and open to new challenges! 🚀
